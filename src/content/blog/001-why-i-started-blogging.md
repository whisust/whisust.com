## 1. Knowledge is best shared

[TBD] I like my knowledge shared and discussed.

## 2. Working on my writing skills

The funny thing is I can't write this first blog post. Let's see how it goes.

## 3. Unload thy mind

It's hard to focus with a lot going in your mind. Write down what is present, work on what matters, come back after to the written part.

## 4. This is the Record of your life

No one will write your biography. Same for your professional track record.
I do this to ensure I do not lose myself to the erosion of time and through a slow and painful entropy descent.
